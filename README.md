# Coffee-Machine-Kotlin-
Hyperskill Project: Coffee Machine (Kotlin)

My first project as a course of Kotlin by the Hyperskill platform.

This project is a simulation of a simple Coffee Machine. The user can make one of 5 choices to interact with the machine.
Command buy to buy a coffee and then selecting the type of coffee.
The code will evaluate if the machine has enough ingredients to make the coffe and them output to the system stream accordingly.
Command fill is used to replenish ingredients.
Command take remove money from the machine
Command remaining prints to the console the state of the machine.
Command exit termites the code.
